### 1. AdTech platform
(Status: In progress)

The WSJ article '[To Facebook You're Worth $80.95](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-CIOB-298)' got me interested into the digital advertisement domain. This project is an attempt to create a simplified version of the advertising platform. It will include all the applications involved in building the basic version of the complete ecosystem.

### 2. Offensive comment detection
(Status: complete)

This is my master thesis work. I solved the offensive comment detection problem for a startup. I used the zero shot learning and multi-task learning. The model gave accuracy of 88% and AUROC of 0.95. Visit the repository at [https://github.com/nikhilbchilwant/Offensive-comments](https://github.com/nikhilbchilwant/Offensive-comments).
